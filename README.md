<h1>About Gara API</h1>
A custom API that allows Gara () to pull a list of makes and models from scraping the web and return it to the app for users to select their vehicles from a pre-defined list.

It currently pulls from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_car_brands

<h5>Needs Doing</h5>

- Adjust web scraper to intake specific country and only return those results
- Create API to use in the Gara app and provide sending and receiving on the data.
- Decide how to implement. For testing purposes, potentially host with docker on a raspberry pi.
